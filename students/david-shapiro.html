	<p>David Shapiro, a native New Yorker, has helped hundreds of people move since 2007. He was one of New Yorkâ€™s top moving estimators before becoming a licensed real estate agent. He also holds a NYS certificate in property management. His combined experience from both industries, coupled with his problem solving approach has been advantageous to clients with difficult property searches and landlords who need assistance with leasing management.</p>
